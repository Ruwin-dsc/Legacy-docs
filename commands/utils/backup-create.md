**Description:** Allows you to create a backup of your Discord server, which can later be imported into a new server using the `backup load` command.  

## 🔹 What Gets Saved?  

Each backup stores the following server elements:  

- Roles  
- Channels  
- Server settings  
- Emojis  
- Member information  
- Banned users  

⚠️ **You can store up to 10 backups at a time.**  

## 🔹 How It Works  

Once you create a backup, you will receive a unique **backup ID**. Keep this ID safe, as it will be required to restore your server on another instance.
