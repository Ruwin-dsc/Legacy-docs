# AFK

***

**Description:** Allows you to set your status as AFK, letting others know you’re unavailable across all servers.

### 💤 How It Works

The AFK command helps notify others that you're away. It includes several useful features to enhance your experience.

#### 🔹 Setting Your AFK Status

To go AFK, simply use the command:

```bash
/afk [reason]
```

* The reason is optional. If left blank, it will default to **"No reason"**.

If you are already AFK and try to set it again, you will receive an error message.

#### 🔹 What Happens When Someone Mentions You?

Whenever someone mentions or replies to you while you're AFK, they will receive an automatic message informing them that you are currently away.

#### 🔹 Disabling AFK Mode

The AFK status is automatically removed when you send a message in any channel. Upon returning, you’ll receive a summary of how long you were AFK and how many mentions you received.
